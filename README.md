# BluePichu
A is a version of the powercord theme LilyPichu made by the awesome programmer NYRI4
I do not take credit for any of the code. All I have done is edit the color values and copied, and edited css' from the powercord discord to better fit the theme

To install this theme, open cmd and execute the command `cd powercord/src/powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/TheStupidOneHere/BluePichu`

To update to the latest version, `cd powercord/src/powercord/themes/BluePichu && git pull`

Again, gentle reminder, none of the code is mine. All credit goes to NYRI4 and the powercord discord
Have a good day!
